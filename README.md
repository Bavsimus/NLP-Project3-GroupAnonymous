CNN + CTC
This model uses a CNN to extract acoustic features and CTC loss for sequence alignment. It performs better than rule-based methods but struggles with long and complex Turkish words.

HuBERT
HuBERT learns speech representations using self-supervised pretraining on large audio data. It improves robustness and achieves lower WER than CNN-CTC.

OpenAI Whisper
Whisper is an end-to-end multilingual speech recognition model. It achieves the best performance due to its strong language modeling capabilities.
